# karma-live-reporter

This is heavily work-in-progress. In fact this is the very first version that somehow works. So use it with low expectations, or wait until I managed to add things like a configuration etc.

However, if you want to try it, do:

`npm install git://github.com/IUnknown68/karma-live-reporter.git#development`

Put 'karma-live-reporter' in your karma-plugins-config.

Add 'live' to your karma-config reporter's list.
